# Contributing to Learning Progress Tracker

Welcome to the Learning Progress Tracker project! This guide will help you get started with contributing to our collaborative learning project.

## üéØ Project Mission

This project is designed to help Python learners of all levels collaborate on a meaningful application while learning key programming concepts, tools, and best practices.

## üë• Team Roles and Skill Levels

### Beginner Level (1-3 months Python experience)
**Perfect for:** First-time contributors, students, bootcamp graduates

**Recommended tasks:**
- Data model improvements (`src/models/`)
- Basic CRUD operations (`src/storage/`)
- CLI enhancements (`src/cli/`)
- Documentation updates
- Writing unit tests
- Bug fixes and small features

**Example contributions:**
```python
# Add new fields to existing models
class Course:
    tags: List[str] = []  # Add course tags
    
# Implement simple utility functions
def format_study_time(minutes: int) -> str:
    """Convert minutes to human-readable format"""
    hours = minutes // 60
    mins = minutes % 60
    return f"{hours}h {mins}m"
```

### Intermediate Level (3-12 months Python experience)
**Perfect for:** Developers with some project experience

**Recommended tasks:**
- Analytics and visualization (`src/analytics/`)
- Reminder system enhancements (`src/reminders/`)
- API endpoints for web app
- Database optimization
- Integration features
- Performance improvements

**Example contributions:**
```python
# Implement data analysis features
def analyze_learning_patterns(sessions: List[StudySession]) -> Dict:
    """Analyze when user is most productive"""
    # Complex analysis logic here
    
# Create visualization functions
def create_progress_heatmap(data: Dict) -> str:
    """Generate a heatmap of study activity"""
    # Matplotlib/Plotly visualization code
```

### Advanced Level (1+ years Python experience)
**Perfect for:** Experienced developers, team leads

**Recommended tasks:**
- Web application architecture (`src/web_app/`)
- Database design and migrations
- Authentication and security
- Deployment and CI/CD
- Code review and mentoring
- Architecture decisions

**Example contributions:**
```python
# Design complex web features
@app.route('/api/advanced-analytics')
def advanced_analytics():
    """Complex analytics with caching and optimization"""
    
# Implement authentication
class UserAuthManager:
    """Handle user authentication and authorization"""
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository

source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Choose Your First Task

**For Beginners:**
1. Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` or `beginner-friendly`
2. Start with documentation improvements
3. Add simple utility functions
4. Write unit tests for existing code
5. Start with validation

**For Intermediate:**
1. Look for issues labeled `enhancement` or `feature`
2. Implement new analytics features

3. Design new major features
4. Set up deployment pipelines

### 3. Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add comments and docstrings
   - Write tests for new functionality

3. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   python -m src.cli --help  # Test CLI
   python -m src.web_app     # Test web app
   ```

4. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: descriptive commit message"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create Pull Request:**
   - Describe what you've implemented
   - Reference any related issues
   - Request review from appropriate team members

## üìã Code Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write descriptive docstrings
- Keep functions focused and small

### Documentation
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add docstrings to all public functions
- Include examples in docstrings
- Update API documentation

### Testing
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases

## üîç Code Review Process
